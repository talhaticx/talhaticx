# 👨‍💻 Talha Ayyaz

 Electrical Engineering student | Code whisperer | Bug summoner

🚀 I write Python like poetry, debug like Sherlock, and break things like it's a hobby.  
⚡ React, Linux, and a little magic with SystemVerilog.  
💾 Currently pretending to be productive at UET and actually doing cool stuff at Home. 
🤖 My code compiles 50% of the time — every time.
